# todolist_py
project for Python course in uni

okay look I tried my best here.
OG idea was much much cooler but either i am too stupid for that or it was shit idea (desktop pet, honestly i just wanted to draw things)
that eneded up being just bunch of poorly controlled GIFs and i lost patience with it a lot... 

so I came up with this To-Do App idea, which in my opinion, could be way more usefull than some dumb dancing GIF crow pet.

AND I MADE IT PRETTY TOO! (yes very important)

Creative work included: 
- picking colors for buttons
- watching tutorials on how to change button size and set spacing between them and pick fonts and change font size and and and (you get it)
- setting background WHICH I DREW MYSELF (WOW LOOK AT ME DOING MOST SIMPLE UI DESING POSSIBLE)
- no but to be serious - desing inspired by Finlayson's pattern  "Aalto", one of their classics, and color palette picked from sunset pics (which i have few too many in my camera roll). I also set button colors to go in other direction compared to background colors so it would make them more visible (big brain moment: using contrast here to improve accessibility of the app for those who may also have lower-than-normal vision). 

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
Code writing done mostly by "google-try-fail-google more-success" -method, combined with countless youtube tutorials.
Python is good for dumbass like me who rahter goes with bashing bricks together than asking way too much embarassing questions and looking stupid, and Google is my new holy grail. 
My library of choice here is Tkinter. Easy and functional, right?


Credits, sources, thanks: 

Apps i used to assist me in this project: ClipStudioPaint, VScode, Google
Sites i used when Google was not very helpful: chatGPT (looked up some tricks with background picture importing in tkinter)

Also special thanks to Roope for helping me and few other students understand Python basics and providing a very good example of how Git works :)


All i can say, I tried my best and actually did thing, here we are. Hope this is alright for first project.
